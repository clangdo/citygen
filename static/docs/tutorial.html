      <h2> Getting Started </h2>
      <h3> Is cityscripting necessary? </h3>
      <p>
        In short, no. The first thing to know about cityscript is that
        generating cities works without any scripting!  A blank script
        will provide you with a full set of default values for
        everything the service needs to generate something that looks
        decent (subjectively).
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, if you'd like to tweak just one thing, you don't have
        to override every default, you can selectively edit the
        appearance of the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to observe the results of the default settings, you
        can click the big green generate button in the interface
        without typing a word into the script. You can open the
        interface <a href="/" target="_blank">in a new tab</a>
        and close it when you're finished to return here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly after clicking, you should see a city image pop up in
        an &quot;Albedo&quot; panel on the right side of the editor.
        This is because you sent a blank cityscript to the service, so
        it used fully default settings for everything.
      </p>

      <h3>Making our city smaller</h3>
      <p>
        One of the simplest things to do is change the dimensions of
        your city. There are two sets of dimensions that cityscripting
        can change, the <code>city</code> dimensions, and the
        <code>image</code> dimensions. Maybe we want to have a much
        smaller area appear, but we want to keep the number of pixels
        in the image the same. We can do this by changing the <code>city</code> dimensions. By
        default we have a 1km x 1km city, you can find this, and other
        defaults in the <a href="/docs/reference.html" target="_blank">reference</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To shrink our rendered city we can type the following.
      </p>
      <pre>
let city.width be 500m<br>
let city.height be 500m
      </pre>
      <p>It's recommended to use units for distances, but it's not
        imperative, cityscript understands <code>m</code> for meters
        and <code>km</code> for kilometers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that you've typed that (make sure each let statement is
        on its own line), go ahead and click the Generate button again,
        you should see much larger rectangular buildings now, and the
        streets should look larger too!
      </p>

      <h3>Distributions, distributions, distributions</h3>
      <p>
        You may notice that if you click the generate button multiple
        times you won't be left with the same city, this is because
        the roads and gaps between buildings are randomly placed based
        on a density distribution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Basically, gaps in the city are spaced out with a random
        number. And you can control the range of this random number.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, maybe you want a city where the blocks are tall
        rectangles. To get that kind of look, the horizontal density
        of the streets would have to be higher than the vertical
        density.
      </p>

      <p>
        The city streets have a two dimensional density distribution.
        To make them taller than they are wide we can do the following
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, maybe you want a city where the blocks are tall
        rectangles. To get that kind of look, the horizontal density
        of the streets would have to be higher than the vertical
        density. To do this, you can do the following.
      </p>

      <pre>
let roads.density.x.max be 20/km
let roads.density.x.min be 10/km
let roads.density.y.max be 5/km
let roads.density.y.max be 3/km
      </pre>

      <p>
        You can also change the distribution type. Most things are
        normally distributed by default, but some are uniformly
        distributed, if we wanted our streets to be spaced with a
        uniform distribution rather than a normal distribution, we
        could use the following
      </p>

      <pre>
let roads.density.x.distribution be uniform
let roads.density.y.distribution be uniform
      </pre>

      <p>
        Distributions can also be constant, in which case they'll
        always use the max value. Distributions can also be skewed
        (when they're normal), like shown below, make sure to delete
        your uniform changes, otherwise the skewing below won't do
        anything.
      </p>

      <pre>
let roads.density.x.skew be 2.0
let roads.density.y.skew be 0.5
      </pre>

      <p>See how this can also be a good way to get a rectangular look?</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      Now you're ready to mess with some things, try changing the following distributions.
      <pre>
roads.density.x
roads.density.y
roads.breadth
buildings.density.x
buildings.density.y
buildings.roof.tint
buildings.roof.border
sidewalks.breadth
alleys.breadth

buildings.walls.stepback
      </pre>

      <p>That last one steps the back walls of buildings further from
        the street, too far and you may get overlapping. Anyway, enjoy playing!</p>
